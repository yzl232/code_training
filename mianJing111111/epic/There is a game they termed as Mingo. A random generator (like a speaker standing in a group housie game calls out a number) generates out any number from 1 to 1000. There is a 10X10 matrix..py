There is a game they termed as Mingo. A random generator (like a speaker standing in a group housie game calls out a number) generates out any number from 1 to 1000.
There is a 10X10 matrix. A random generator assigns values to each block of this matrix(within 1 to 1000 obviously).
Whenever, a row or a column or a diagonal is fully filled in this 10x10 from the numbers called out by the speaker, its called a 'Mingo'.
Write a program that will find first Mingo, then second Mingo, then thirds Mingo...and so forth.
