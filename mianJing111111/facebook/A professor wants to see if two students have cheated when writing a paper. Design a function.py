A professor wants to see if two students have cheated when writing a paper. Design a function : hasCheated(String s1,String s2, int N) that evaluates to true if two strings have a common substring of length N. Additional question after implementation. Assume you don't have the possibility of using String.contains() and String.substring(). How would you implement this?
