'''
Anagram solver. An anagram is two words that contains the same letters
the same amount of times. For example, angle and angel are anagrams. Given a
dictionary, perform some preprocessing for a anagram solver. The anagram
solver takes a string as input and prints out a list of all anagrams
contained in the dictionary.
