Forced context switching

In computing, a context switch is the process of

storing and restoring the state (context) of a process or thread „ÄÅ

so that execution can be resumed from the same point at a later time.

 This enables multiple processes to share a single CPU and is an essential feature of a multitasking operating system.

 What constitutes the context is determined by the processor and the operating system.[1]

Context switches are usually computationally intensive, and much of the design of operating systems is to optimize the use of context switches
