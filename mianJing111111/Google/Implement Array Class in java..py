Implement Array Class in java.

I think the interviewer wanted you to understand that an array must be contiguous and not a linked list. That is, you must have capacity, which is the amount of memory allocated, and size, which is the actual size of the array. So, when the user resizes the array with size > capacity, you must reallocate memory and copy the values from the old to the new array.
