Consider a hash table with M slots. Suppose hash value is uniformly distributed between 1 to M, and it uses linked list to handle conflicts (if two keys hashed to the same slot). Suppose we put N keys into this M-slotted hash table, what is the probability that there will be a slot with i elements? i could vary from 0 to N.
